# MVP Progress Update

Today, I made significant progress on the MVP for our startup idea. I implemented the core functionality and started working on the user interface. There's still a lot to do, but I'm excited about the direction we're heading.

Key accomplishments:
1. Implemented user authentication
2. Created the main dashboard layout
3. Started working on the data visualization components

Next steps:
- Finish the remaining UI components
- Integrate with the backend API
- Begin user testing
