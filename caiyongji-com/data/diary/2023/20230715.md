# Brainstorming Session Results

Today, we had an incredibly productive brainstorming session with the team. We explored various ideas for expanding our product's feature set and discussed potential market opportunities.

Key outcomes:
1. Identified three new features to prioritize in the next sprint
2. Developed a preliminary roadmap for Q3
3. Assigned research tasks to team members for validating our assumptions

Next steps:
- Conduct user interviews to gather feedback on proposed features
- Create wireframes for the top priority feature
- Schedule a follow-up meeting to refine our Q3 roadmap
