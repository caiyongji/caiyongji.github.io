# Investor Pitch Preparation

Spent the day refining our investor pitch deck and practicing our presentation. We're gearing up for a crucial meeting with potential investors next week.

Accomplishments:
1. Streamlined our pitch deck, reducing it from 20 to 15 impactful slides
2. Conducted a mock presentation with the leadership team
3. Prepared answers for anticipated questions

To-do:
- Finalize financial projections with our CFO
- Run through the pitch at least twice more before the meeting
- Prepare handouts with key metrics for the investors

Feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness, but confident in our preparation!
